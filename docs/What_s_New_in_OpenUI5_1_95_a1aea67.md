**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V2 model introduces the following features:

-   The optional `bDeleteCreatedEntities` parameter has been added to the `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges` method. If set to `true`, any created entities are removed.

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#deleteCreatedEntry` method has been deprecated. It does not update controls but cannot be changed for compatibility reasons. Applications should use `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges` instead.

We have improved the accessibility of the control, and the screen readers now announce when there is a change in the text, tooltip, or icon in a stand-alone `sap.m.Button`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.Button).

**`sap.m.DatePicker, sap.m.DateRangeSelection, sap.m.DateTimePicker, and sap.ui.unified.Calendar`**

These controls now have the new property `showCurrentDateButton`, which displays an additional button in the navigation part of the calendar. When pressed, the control navigates to the current date and focuses on it. This feature is available for pickers whose display format allows picking a day. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.DatePicker) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.DatePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePicker).
